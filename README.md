The inductive nature of artificial neural models makes dataset quality a key factor of their proper functionality. For this reason, multiple research studies proposed metrics to assess the quality of their datasets, such as correctness, completeness, and consistency. However these studies commonly lack a point of reference against which the proposed quality metrics could be assessed.
